# Mathematics Basics: Factorization

## 1. Definition of Factorization
- **Factorization**: The process of breaking down a number, expression, or polynomial into smaller components (factors) that, when multiplied together, give the original number or expression.
- **Prime Factorization**: Factorizing a number into its prime factors (numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves).
  
#### Example:
- **Number**: `12`
  - Prime factorization of 12 is `2² * 3`.
- **Expression**: `x² - 4`
  - Factorized form: `(x - 2)(x + 2)`.

## 2. Types of Factorization

### a) **Prime Factorization**
- **Definition**: Breaking a number into its prime factors.
- **Steps**: 
  1. Start by dividing the number by the smallest prime number.
  2. Continue dividing until all factors are prime numbers.
  
#### Example: Prime factorization of 60
- Divide 60 by 2: `60 ÷ 2 = 30`
- Divide 30 by 2: `30 ÷ 2 = 15`
- Divide 15 by 3: `15 ÷ 3 = 5`
- 5 is prime, so the factorization stops here.
- **Prime Factorization**: `60 = 2² * 3 * 5`

---

### b) **Factorization of Quadratic Expressions**
- **Definition**: Expressing quadratic equations as a product of binomials.
- **Steps**: Look for two numbers that multiply to give the constant term and add up to give the coefficient of the middle term.
  
#### Example: Factorize `x² + 5x + 6`
- Find two numbers that multiply to `6` and add to `5`: These numbers are `2` and `3`.
- Factorized form: `(x + 2)(x + 3)`.

---

### c) **Difference of Squares**
- **Definition**: A special type of factorization where an expression is the difference of two perfect squares.
- **Formula**:  
  `a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)`
  
#### Example: Factorize `x² - 9`
- `x² - 9` is a difference of squares because `9 = 3²`.
- Factorized form: `(x + 3)(x - 3)`.

---

### d) **Perfect Square Trinomial**
- **Definition**: A trinomial that is the square of a binomial.
- **Formula**:  
  `a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²`  
  or  
  `a² - 2ab + b² = (a - b)²`
  
#### Example: Factorize `x² + 6x + 9`
- Recognize that it fits the form `a² + 2ab + b²` where `a = x` and `b = 3`.
- Factorized form: `(x + 3)²`.

---

### e) **Grouping**
- **Definition**: A method used when there are four terms in a polynomial.
- **Steps**: Group terms in pairs and factor each pair separately, then factor out the common binomial.
  
#### Example: Factorize `x³ + 3x² + 2x + 6`
- Group terms: `(x³ + 3x²) + (2x + 6)`
- Factor each group: `x²(x + 3) + 2(x + 3)`
- Factor out the common binomial: `(x + 3)(x² + 2)`.

---

## 3. Common Factorization Techniques

### a) **Factor by Taking Out the Common Factor**
- **Definition**: If all terms share a common factor, it can be factored out.
  
#### Example: Factorize `6x² + 12x`
- The common factor is `6x`.
- Factorized form: `6x(x + 2)`.

---

### b) **Factorization of Cubic Expressions**
- **Formula for sum and difference of cubes**:
  - `a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)`
  - `a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)`
  
#### Example: Factorize `x³ - 8`
- Recognize that `8 = 2³`.
- Use the difference of cubes formula: `(x - 2)(x² + 2x + 4)`.

---

## 4. Special Cases and Formulas

### a) **Sum of Squares (Non-Factorizable in Real Numbers)**
- The sum of two squares cannot be factored in real numbers. For example, `x² + 4` cannot be factorized into real binomials.

---

### b) **Factorization of Expressions Involving Common Denominators**
- When working with fractions, factor out the common denominator or numerator.

## 6. Special Considerations
- **Factorization in Real vs. Complex Numbers**: Some expressions like `a² + b²` cannot be factorized in real numbers, but they can be in complex numbers.
- **Factoring in Polynomials**: Larger polynomials may require synthetic division or long division to factor them completely.
