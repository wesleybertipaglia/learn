# Mathematics Basics: Percent

## 1. Definition of Percent
- **Percent**: A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The word "percent" comes from the Latin "per centum," which means "by the hundred."
- **Symbol**: `%`
- **Formula**:  
  `Percentage (%) = (Part / Whole) * 100`

#### Example:
- If you scored 45 out of 50 on a test, the percentage score is calculated as:  
  `Percentage = (45 / 50) * 100 = 90%`

---

## 2. How to Calculate Percent

### a) **Finding the Percentage of a Number**
- To find the percentage of a number, multiply the number by the percentage (in decimal form).
  
#### Example:
- What is 20% of 250?  
  `20% = 20 / 100 = 0.20`
  `0.20 * 250 = 50`
  
  So, 20% of 250 is **50**.

---

### b) **Finding What Percentage One Number is of Another**
- To find what percentage one number is of another, divide the first number (the part) by the second number (the whole), and then multiply by 100.
  
#### Example:
- What percentage of 50 is 15?  
  `Percentage = (15 / 50) * 100 = 30%`
  
  So, 15 is 30% of 50.

---

### c) **Finding the Whole When Given the Percentage**
- To find the whole (original number), divide the part by the percentage (in decimal form).
  
#### Example:
- If 20% of a number is 40, what is the whole number?  
  `Whole = 40 / (20 / 100) = 40 / 0.20 = 200`
  
  So, the whole number is **200**.

## 3. Percent Increase and Decrease

### a) **Percent Increase**
- To calculate a **percent increase**, subtract the original value from the new value, divide by the original value, and multiply by 100.
  
#### Example:
- If a shirt's price increases from $50 to $60, the percent increase is:  
  `Percent Increase = ((60 - 50) / 50) * 100 = (10 / 50) * 100 = 20%`
  
  So, the price increased by **20%**.

---

### b) **Percent Decrease**
- To calculate a **percent decrease**, subtract the new value from the original value, divide by the original value, and multiply by 100.
  
#### Example:
- If a shirt’s price drops from $60 to $50, the percent decrease is:  
  `Percent Decrease = ((60 - 50) / 60) * 100 = (10 / 60) * 100 ≈ 16.67%`
  
  So, the price decreased by approximately **16.67%**.

|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Finding the percentage of a number     | `Percentage = (Part / Whole) * 100`             | `40% of 250`                               | `100`               |
| Finding what percentage one number is of another | `Percentage = (Part / Whole) * 100`             | `What percentage of 200 is 50?`            | `25%`               |
| Finding the whole number               | `Whole = Part / (Percentage / 100)`             | `20% of a number is 40. What’s the whole?`  | `200`               |
| Percent increase                       | `Percent Increase = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100` | `Price increase from $50 to $60`           | `20%`               |
| Percent decrease                       | `Percent Decrease = ((Old Value - New Value) / Old Value) * 100` | `Price decrease from $60 to $50`           | `16.67%`            |

## 5. Common Percent Equivalents

| **Percent** | **Decimal** | **Fraction** |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1%          | 0.01        | 1/100        |
| 10%         | 0.10        | 1/10         |
| 25%         | 0.25        | 1/4          |
| 50%         | 0.50        | 1/2          |
| 75%         | 0.75        | 3/4          |
| 100%        | 1.00        | 1            |

## 6. Applications of Percent

### a) **Discounts**
- To calculate a discount, find the percentage of the original price and subtract it from the original price.
  
#### Example:
- An item costs $80, and there’s a 25% discount.  
  Discount = `25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20`.  
  New price = `80 - 20 = 60`.  
  So, the item is now **$60**.

---

### b) **Interest Rates (Simple Interest)**
- The interest earned on a principal amount is calculated using the formula:  
  `Interest = Principal * Rate * Time`
  - Where `Rate` is in decimal form (e.g., 5% = 0.05).

---

### c) **Grading Systems**
- Percentages are often used in grading systems. For example, if you score 80 out of 100 on a test, your score is 80%, which means you got 80% of the answers correct.
