# Mathematics Basics: Modulus (Absolute Value)

- **Modulus (or Absolute Value)**: The modulus of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. It is always non-negative.
- **Formula**:  
  - `|x|` (absolute value of `x`)
- **Examples**:  
  - `|5| = 5`  
  - `|-3| = 3`  
  - `|0| = 0`
