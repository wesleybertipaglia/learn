# Mathematics Basics: Fractions

## 1. Definition of a Fraction
- A **fraction** represents a part of a whole. It is a way to express numbers that are not whole.
- **Structure**: A fraction has two parts:
  - **Numerator**: The number on the top (how many parts we have).
  - **Denominator**: The number on the bottom (how many equal parts the whole is divided into).

  Example:  
  In the fraction `3/4`, `3` is the numerator and `4` is the denominator.

## 2. Types of Fractions

### a) **Proper Fractions**
- A proper fraction is when the numerator is less than the denominator.
  
#### Example:
- `3/4`, `5/8`, `7/9`

### b) **Improper Fractions**
- An improper fraction is when the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.
  
#### Example:
- `5/4`, `9/8`, `12/12`

### c) **Mixed Numbers**
- A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction.
  
#### Example:
- `1 1/2`, `3 3/4`, `5 2/3`

### d) **Equivalent Fractions**
- Fractions that represent the same value, even though they have different numerators and denominators.
  
#### Example:
- `1/2 = 2/4 = 4/8`

## 3. Operations with Fractions

### a) **Addition and Subtraction of Fractions**

#### 1. **Same Denominator**
- When the fractions have the same denominator, simply add or subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same.

#### Example:
- `3/7 + 2/7 = (3 + 2)/7 = 5/7`
- `5/8 - 3/8 = (5 - 3)/8 = 2/8 = 1/4` (simplified)

#### 2. **Different Denominators**
- If the fractions have different denominators, first find a common denominator (often the least common denominator or LCD), then add or subtract the numerators.

#### Example:
- `1/4 + 1/6`
  - Find LCD of 4 and 6, which is 12.
  - Convert: `1/4 = 3/12` and `1/6 = 2/12`.
  - Now add: `3/12 + 2/12 = 5/12`.

### b) **Multiplication of Fractions**
- To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and the denominators separately.
  
#### Example:
- `2/3 * 4/5 = (2 * 4)/(3 * 5) = 8/15`

### c) **Division of Fractions**
- To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal (flip the second fraction).

#### Example:
- `2/3 ÷ 4/5`
  - Reciprocal of `4/5` is `5/4`.
  - Multiply: `2/3 * 5/4 = (2 * 5)/(3 * 4) = 10/12 = 5/6` (simplified).

## 4. Simplifying Fractions
- **Simplification**: To simplify a fraction, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

#### Example:
- `6/8`
  - The GCD of 6 and 8 is 2.
  - Simplify: `6 ÷ 2 = 3` and `8 ÷ 2 = 4`.
  - The simplified fraction is `3/4`.

## 5. Converting Fractions

### a) **Fraction to Decimal**
- Divide the numerator by the denominator to convert a fraction to a decimal.

#### Example:
- `3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75`

### b) **Decimal to Fraction**
- To convert a decimal to a fraction, count the number of decimal places and write the number as a fraction, then simplify if needed.

#### Example:
- `0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4` (simplified)

### c) **Fraction to Percent**
- To convert a fraction to a percentage, multiply the fraction by 100.

#### Example:
- `3/4 = (3/4) * 100 = 75%`

---

## 6. Key Fraction Properties

### a) **Reciprocal**
- The **reciprocal** of a fraction is obtained by swapping the numerator and the denominator.
  
#### Example:
- The reciprocal of `2/3` is `3/2`.

### b) **Negative Fractions**
- A negative fraction can have the negative sign either in the numerator or the denominator, or outside the fraction.
  
#### Example:
- `-3/4 = 3/-4 = -3/-4` (all are equivalent).
