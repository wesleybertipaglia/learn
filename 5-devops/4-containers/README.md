# Containers

Containers are a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient software package that contains everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. They are isolated from the underlying infrastructure and other containers, making them an ideal solution for deploying and managing applications in a consistent and efficient manner.

Containers are based on the concept of containerization, which involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a single, executable unit that can run on any platform without modification. This approach offers several advantages over traditional virtual machines, such as faster startup times, lower resource consumption, and greater scalability.
