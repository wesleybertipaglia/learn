# Data Structures

Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data. There are many different types of data structures, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
