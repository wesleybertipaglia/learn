# Testing

Software testing is an important process that ensures the quality and functionality of software applications. It involves various techniques and methodologies to identify and fix bugs, verify features, and improve the overall performance of software systems. 

Testing helps ensure that the software meets the requirements and works as expected in real-world scenarios. From basic unit testing to complex system-wide integration testing, the following topics cover the foundations and key tools used in modern testing practices.
