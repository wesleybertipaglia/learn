# Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.

```python
sum = 10 + 5
sub = 10 - 5
mul = 10 * 5
div = 10 / 5
mod = 10 % 5
exp = 10 ** 5
```

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

```python
equal = 10 == 5
not_equal = 10 != 5
greater_than = 10 > 5
less_than = 10 < 5
greater_than_or_equal = 10 >= 5
less_than_or_equal = 10 <= 5
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

```python
and_op = True and False
or_op = True or False
not_op = not True
```

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

```python
atribution = 10
atribution_plus += 5
atribution_minus -= 5
atribution_mul *= 5
atribution_div /= 5
atribution_mod %= 5
atribution_exp **= 5
```

## Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location.

```python
is_op = 10 is 5
is_not_op = 10 is not 5
```

## Membership Operators

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.

```python
in_op = 10 in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
not_in_op = 10 not in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers.

```python
and_op = 10 & 5
or_op = 10 | 5
xor_op = 10 ^ 5
not_op = ~10
left_shift = 10 << 5
right_shift = 10 >> 5
```

## Precedence and Associativity

The precedence and associativity of operators determine the order in which the operations are performed.

```python
result = 10 + 5 * 2 # 20 -> 5 * 2 = 10 + 10 = 20
result = (10 + 5) * 2 # 30 -> 10 + 5 = 15 * 2 = 30
```
