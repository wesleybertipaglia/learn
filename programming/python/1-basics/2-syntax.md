    print("Five is greater than two!")
```

## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

```python
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
```

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

```python
def my_function():
    print("Hello from a function")

my_function()
```

## Lambda

A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

```python
x = lambda a : a + 10

print(x(5)) # Output: 15
```
