# Internet Overview

## What is the Internet?
The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols (primarily TCP/IP). It allows for the transmission of data, enabling activities such as email, file sharing, and streaming media. The Internet has revolutionized communication, commerce, and access to information.

## What is the World Wide Web (WWW)?
The World Wide Web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents and multimedia content accessed via the Internet. It uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and enables users to browse websites and interact with online content through web pages. While often conflated with the Internet, the Web is just one of many services that run on it.

## What are Browsers?
Web browsers are software applications that allow users to access and navigate the World Wide Web. They interpret HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and render web pages for users to interact with. Common browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.

## Key Figures in the Invention of the Internet and the Browser
1. **Tim Berners-Lee**: Credited with inventing the World Wide Web in 1989, Berners-Lee developed the first web browser (WorldWideWeb) and the first web server. He introduced essential technologies like HTML, HTTP, and URLs, which are foundational to the Web.

2. **Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn**: Known as the "fathers of the Internet," they developed the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), which are crucial for data transmission over the Internet.

## A Brief History
- **1960s**: The concept of a network of computers emerged, with ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) being the first operational packet-switching network, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense.

- **1970s**: The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed by Cerf and Kahn, allowing different networks to connect and communicate. In 1983, TCP/IP became the standard for ARPANET.

- **1980s**: The term "Internet" began to be used to describe the interconnected network of networks. The National Science Foundation (NSF) launched NSFNET, which further expanded access.

- **1990s**: Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web, making the Internet more accessible to the general public. The first web browser (Mosaic) was released in 1993, leading to explosive growth in Internet usage.

- **2000s-Present**: The Internet has evolved with advancements in technology, including broadband access, mobile Internet, and the rise of social media. The Web continues to grow, with billions of websites and users worldwide.

## Surprising Facts
- The first website ever created is still online: itâ€™s a simple page about the World Wide Web, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.

- The Internet is not owned by any single entity; it operates on a decentralized model, maintained by a collaborative effort of organizations, companies, and governments worldwide.

- There are more than **1.9 billion websites** as of 2024, showcasing the vastness and diversity of content available online.
