# Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform used for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight, portable containers.

## Why Use Docker?

1. **Consistency:** Docker ensures that your application runs the same way, regardless of where it is deployed.

2. **Isolation:** Applications run in their own containers, ensuring that dependencies and configurations do not conflict.

3. **Portability:** Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, making it easier to move applications between environments.

4. **Efficiency:** Containers are lightweight and share the host systemâ€™s kernel, making them more efficient than virtual machines.

5. **Scalability:** Docker makes it easy to scale applications up or down quickly and efficiently.

## Key Concepts

- **Containers:** Lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and settings. Containers isolate the application from the environment, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of where it is run.

- **Images:** Read-only templates used to create containers. An image might be an OS image or an application stack. Images are built from a set of instructions written in a `Dockerfile`, which specifies the environment and configuration for the application.

- **Volumes:** Mechanisms for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes are stored outside the container's filesystem, making it possible to share data between containers and persist data beyond the life of a container.

- **Networking:** Docker's networking feature allows containers to communicate with each other and with non-Docker environments. Docker provides several network drivers (e.g., bridge, host, overlay) to support different use cases and ensure secure and efficient communication between containers.
