# Network Devices

Network devices are hardware components that facilitate communication and data transfer between different devices within a network.

## 1. Connectivity Devices
These devices facilitate connections between multiple networks or network segments.

### Router
- **Function**: Connects different networks and routes data between them.
- **Key Features**:
  - Manages traffic within the network.
  - Provides access to the internet.
  - Supports various protocols (e.g., TCP/IP).

### Switch
- **Function**: Connects devices within the same network.
- **Key Features**:
  - Operates at the data link layer (Layer 2).
  - Forwards data based on MAC addresses.
  - Reduces collisions and improves network efficiency.

### Hub
- **Function**: Connects multiple Ethernet devices, making them act as a single network segment.
- **Key Features**:
  - Operates at the physical layer (Layer 1).
  - Broadcasts data to all connected devices.
  - Less efficient than switches.

### Access Point (AP)
- **Function**: Allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.
- **Key Features**:
  - Extends wireless coverage.
  - Supports multiple devices.
  - Often includes security features like WPA2.

### Repeater
- **Function**: Extends the range of a network by amplifying signals.
- **Key Features**:
  - Used in long-distance networks.
  - Can be wired or wireless.
  - Helps maintain signal integrity over distances.

### Bridge
- **Function**: Connects and filters traffic between two or more network segments.
- **Key Features**:
  - Operates at the data link layer (Layer 2).
  - Reduces traffic and collisions.
  - Useful for connecting different network types.

### Gateway
- **Function**: Serves as a "gate" between two networks.
- **Key Features**:
  - Translates communication protocols.
  - Can connect different network architectures.
  - Often used in enterprise environments.

## 2. Security Devices
These devices protect the network and manage traffic.

### Firewall
- **Function**: Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **Key Features**:
  - Protects against unauthorized access.
  - Can be hardware or software-based.
  - Configurable rules for traffic management.

## 3. Access Devices
These devices enable hosts to connect to the network.

### Network Interface Card (NIC)
- **Function**: Enables devices to connect to a network.
- **Key Features**:
  - Can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).
  - Contains a unique MAC address.
  - Interfaces with the deviceâ€™s operating system.

## 4. Data Transmission Devices
These devices facilitate the conversion and transmission of data.

### Modem
- **Function**: Modulates and demodulates signals for internet access.
- **Key Features**:
  - Connects to an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
  - Converts digital data to analog signals and vice versa.
  - Can be combined with routers (gateway).

## 5. Hosts and Servers
### Hosts
- **Definition**: Any device connected to a network that can send or receive data. Examples include computers, smartphones, and printers.

### Servers
- **Definition**: A specialized type of host that provides resources, services, or data to other devices (clients) over a network. Examples include web servers, file servers, and database servers.
