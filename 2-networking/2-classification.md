# Network Classification

Networks can be categorized in different ways based on their characteristics, such as size, connection method, ownership, scope, and topology.

The classification helps understand the different types of networks and how they operate.

## Size

Networks can vary in size:

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Small area, like a home or office.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Spans a city or campus.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Connects across large distances, including globally.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Used for personal devices, usually within a short range (e.g., Bluetooth).

## Topology (Physical layout of the network)

Different network topologies include:

- **Star**: All devices are connected to a central hub.
- **Bus**: All devices share a single communication line.
- **Ring**: Devices are connected in a circular loop.
- **Mesh**: Every device is connected to several others, providing multiple paths for data.

## Scope

Networks can have different scopes based on their purpose:

- **Intranet**: Internal network for private use, typically within an organization.
- **Extranet**: A private network that allows controlled access to external users.
- **Internet**: The global network connecting millions of devices worldwide.

## Ownership

Networks can be categorized based on ownership:

- **Private**: Owned by an individual or organization, like home or office networks.
- **Public**: Open for public use, such as free Wi-Fi in public spaces.

## Connection Method

Devices can connect in different ways:

- **Wired**: Uses physical cables, like Ethernet, fiber-optic, or coaxial cables.
- **Wireless**: Uses radio waves, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Devices communicate directly without a central server.

## Transmission Method

Networks can transmit data in different ways:

- **Analog**: Uses continuous signals to transmit data.
- **Digital**: Transmits data in discrete bits.
